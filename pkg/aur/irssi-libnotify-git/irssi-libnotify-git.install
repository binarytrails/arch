Plugin Activation
-----------------

To enable this plugin for your local user account, link it to your
irssi autorun scripts:

    ln -s /usr/share/irssi/scripts/notify.pl ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/

Background Task
---------------

    systemctl daemon-reload --user
    systemctl --user enable notify-listener --now

Remote Access
-------------

If you are running irssi remotely, currently your remote machine account
will need to be able to ssh to your local machine without a passphrase.
You will need to set that up yourself, e.g. by using:

    ssh-copy-id

Then, to activate the remote notification in irssi, use:

    /SET notify_remote <HOST>

Replace <HOST> with the name or IP address of the local machine you are
on, as it would be known to the remote machine. This is most useful if
you are on the same local network with the other box (firewalls or other
non-local routing will probably make it difficult to use this feature).
